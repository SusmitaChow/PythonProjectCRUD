Film Industry Insights: Data-Driven Analysis and Strategic Recommendations-
The SQL coding for film analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset and offers insights into various aspects of the film industry. It begins with data exploration, examining key tables such as movies, genres, ratings, and names. Through structured queries and careful analysis, it identifies trends and patterns within the dataset. The coding then delves into specific tasks, such as determining the top directors, actors, and production houses based on various criteria like movie ratings, number of votes, and genres. It also categorizes movies into different genres based on their average ratings and classifies them as superhit, hit, one-time-watch, or flop. Furthermore, the coding showcases the calculation of metrics like running total and moving averages of movie durations across different genres. It also highlights the top-grossing movies each year within the top three genres, providing valuable insights into box office performance. Additionally, the coding addresses the analysis of multilingual movies and identifies the production houses that have produced the highest number of hits. It also ranks actresses based on the number of super hit movies in the drama genre. Overall, the SQL coding offers a structured and concise approach to film analysis, providing executives with actionable insights backed by factual data. It serves as a valuable tool for decision-making and strategic planning within the film industry.
