Python CRUD Project-
In the rapidly evolving e-commerce sector, the ability to efficiently manage and accurately maintain product information is crucial for operational success and customer satisfaction. Recognizing the challenges businesses face in keeping up with the extensive and dynamic nature of product data, our project aims to develop Automated Product Information. Management System (APIMS) tailored for e-commerce platforms. This system will leverage advanced programming techniques and technologies to provide a comprehensive solution for the seamless handling of product details, sales data, and product descriptions.

Credit Risk Analysis Project-
The project aims to analyze patterns in client data to identify indicators of loan repayment difficulties. By understanding the driving factors behind loan default, the company can improve risk assessment and portfolio management strategies. The ultimate goal is to ensure that deserving clients are not rejected while mitigating risks associated with lending.

Film Industry Insights: Data-Driven Analysis and Strategic Recommendations-
The SQL coding for film analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset and offers insights into various aspects of the film industry. It begins with data exploration, examining key tables such as movies, genres, ratings, and names. Through structured queries and careful analysis, it identifies trends and patterns within the dataset. The coding then delves into specific tasks, such as determining the top directors, actors, and production houses based on various criteria like movie ratings, number of votes, and genres. It also categorizes movies into different genres based on their average ratings and classifies them as superhit, hit, one-time-watch, or flop. Furthermore, the coding showcases the calculation of metrics like running total and moving averages of movie durations across different genres. It also highlights the top-grossing movies each year within the top three genres, providing valuable insights into box office performance. Additionally, the coding addresses the analysis of multilingual movies and identifies the production houses that have produced the highest number of hits. It also ranks actresses based on the number of super hit movies in the drama genre. Overall, the SQL coding offers a structured and concise approach to film analysis, providing executives with actionable insights backed by factual data. It serves as a valuable tool for decision-making and strategic planning within the film industry.

Develop and fine-tune a text summarization model using the Flax Pegasus architecture (Internship)- 
During my internship, I undertook a challenging project focusing on enhancing text summarization using the Flax Pegasus model. I began by implementing the model using the `transformers` library with a JAX/Flax backend, ensuring efficient computation and scalability. Data preprocessing was a crucial aspect of my work, where I developed robust pipelines using `AutoTokenizer` to prepare input sequences for training and evaluation. A significant part of my internship involved optimizing the model's performance through rigorous experimentation and evaluation. I utilized standard NLP metrics to assess the quality of generated summaries, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in text summarization tasks. Throughout the project, I maintained detailed documentation of methodologies and findings, facilitating knowledge sharing and ensuring reproducibility of results. This experience not only deepened my technical expertise in natural language processing and machine learning but also honed my skills in problem-solving, experimental design, and effective communication within a collaborative team environment.
